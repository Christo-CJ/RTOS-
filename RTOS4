Before calling os_sys_init then before calling the function iniialize the init parameters
Once started it will not coming back to main function.
After creating idle task it create task 1.

Suppose task 1 is created address of task 1 is given to kernel.Kernel will create task 1 with given priority.
Every task has unique priority.
While calling this function we doesn't have option to set priorty so kernel will create task 1 and give priority 1.
which task is given in os_sys_init get priority level1.
Later can change priority using priority function.

Suppose give different priority os_sys_init_prio(task1,prio_level);
1 to 254(low to high)
prio_level is a integer value 1 to 254.
