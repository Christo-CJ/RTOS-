Before calling os_sys_init then before calling the function iniialize the init parameters
Once started it will not coming back to main function.
After creating idle task it create task 1.

Suppose task 1 is created address of task 1 is given to kernel.Kernel will create task 1 with given priority.
Every task has unique priority.
While calling this function we doesn't have option to set priorty so kernel will create task 1 and give priority 1.
which task is given in os_sys_init get priority level1.
Later can change priority using priority function.

Suppose give different priority os_sys_init_prio(task1,prio_level);
1 to 254(low to high)
prio_level is a integer value 1 to 254.
we cannot use both os_sys_init and os_sys_init_prio at same time.

os_tsk_create
--------------
This function is used to create a new task to running RTOS and adds it to ready state.

prototype:
---------
OS_TID os_tsk_create(void(*task)(void),u8 prio);

prio 1-255
void(*task)(void) - task address

Return value
------------
on success: Task ID (TID)  ->file descriptor as same in fopen
on failure: 0

with help of TID we can do task activities like change prio,delet task,sync,etc..


setting up a project in kel ide
-------------------------------
keil for RTX.

1.create a new project and a startup code into source group
2.select "RTX_kernel" option from target settings.
   Right click on target->Options for target-->Operating system -->RTX kernel.
3.Add configuration file into source group
  Name of config file: RTX_conf_LPC21xx.c
  path: C:keil_v5\ARM\RL\RTX\config
4.Startup code setting
  +comment out line 259 
  +add below line at line number 257
       IMPORT SWI_Handler
(before writing IMPORT SWI_Handler use a tab space)
5.Write a main.c an ass it to source group.
