Introduction to Real-time system and Real time operating system

On top of mircrocontroller we have written program like driver and application
now we are going to run rtos on microcontroller on top of rtos we  are writting drivers and applications.

what ever aapplication writing ovre rtos is real time applications, driver is also part of application.

rtos is small os specially designed for microcontroller(MC)
rtos can be run on any microcontroller 8051,arm controller,avr,pic,...

OS will provide interface between application and hardware and hardware with application.

Role of OS is resource management 
middleware software is called OS which will provide graphical user interface.
between software and Hardware.
it can take care of multi tasking.
like keyboard,mouse,internet,screen... all working parallelly because of OS.

OS will take input from hardware to application then from application to software.

when we buy our laptop we dont know keyboard program but it is available in OS so we no need to write.

RTOS is different from GPOS general purpose(windows ,linux)
GPOS display gui.what able to see on software is GPOS gui.
RTOS is not designed for MC,where no gui is used.
